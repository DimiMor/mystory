        <p class="story"><span class="who">Who am I?</span> <br><br>My curiosity and my will for improvement have made
            me a person who loves to innovate. I learned during my first projects attempts that a very necessary skill
            needed is analysis. Most of my mistakes in the begin was by taking an initiative without previous analysis.
            But this was not enough to change me, so I became an extremely analytical person who take a lot of attention
            to details. My professional career has become focused in constant search for improvement and development of
            new tools and process, creatin solutions using menagement concepts like PDCA and 5W2H and also worhing with
            systems such as Adavnced Excel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qlik" target="_blank"> QlikView</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableau_Software" target="_blank">Tableau</a>, and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableau_Software" target="_blank">Power BI</a>. <br>Another
            characteristic very present in my life is how I relate to other people, especially in delicate moments, I
            can keep calm and coordinate actions and behaviors. Puting toghether these characteristics, I worked more
            than 10 years as a Business analyst interpreting and managing demands from business and technical areas. And
            since I can't get stuck in one thing so, I'm currently in love with the development and web programming.
            Dedicating my time to learn and expand my knowledge in tools such as HTML, CSS, JS, React, etc.<br> Lets see
            where this will bring me... </p>

            ingressed at <a href="https://www.unifor.br/" target="_blank">University of Fortaleza (Unifor) </a>in The
            Business Admninstration program. During my time in University I never stoped to work, what realy helped me
            to understand better the disciplines and put in paractice what I was learning. I gratuted in 2010, but after
            that I started the search for specific knowledge in the Business Inteligence area. In 2015 I did a great
            course to learn how to Map and improve process with the <a href="https://www.falconi.com/en/"

            development. So again I went deep in study to learn about it. In 2019 I did an online course for HTML, CSS,
            JS, and React at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"> Codecademy</a>, after that in 2020 I

        <p class="education"><span class="who">Being part of a team.</span> <br><br>My first formal job was exactly the
            day I turned 19 years old, but I will start telling my experience when I was hired by the largest coffee
            company in Brazil:<br><a href="www.cafe3coracoes.com.br" targe="_blank"> - Café 3Coracoes.</a><br> In this
            company learned all the foundation for the work as Business Analyst and I can say that I made part of the
            most competitive team that I ever had, there I worked for 9 years and a half, initially working as a data
            analyst responsible for collecting all the data from the commercial area and feeding the dashboards and
            reports for the commercial management and commercial board. After 3 years I was invited to be responsible
            for implanting the business intelligence sector in the Sao Paulo branch. After working for another 3 years
            in the area of Business Intelligence I was transferred to the commercial area where I worked as Sales
            Supervisor and Sales Manager. I left the company to try my own business, which was an amazing experience,
            but I received an offer to work in a company called:<br><a href="http://www.cialne.com.br/"
                target="_blank">- CIALNE.</a><br> There I acted as Manager of Business Intelligence for 4 years. My
            responsibility was to lead a team of analysts to improve the company’s processes, create and improve tools
            in partnership with the IT department and commercial area, and manage new projects. During the time working
            in this company I improved a lot my management skills because I was working directly with the CEO of the
            company and a team of external consultants. I left the company to move to Canada, and arriving here my first
            entry level job was as customer service agent in a call center company called:<br><a
                href="https://millennium1solutions.com/" target="_blank">- Millennium 1 Solutions.</a><br> I used to
            work with the PC MasterCard account, where I worked for one year and a half, starting in the sales area and
            then being transferred to the customer's retention area also training new agents. Finally the last company I
            have worked untill September 2020 was:<br><a
                href="https://www.cascades.com/en/facilities/cascades-recovery-ottawa" target="_blank"> - Casacades
                Recovery +.</a> <br>I was hired as Scale Administrator responsible for controlling the entry and exit of
            all shipments, ensuring that they are within the defined parameters, also feeding daily spreadsheets and
            System, and sending daily reports to the administrative area. In this company I had the opportunity to
            improve tools and optimize processes as well.</p>
