        <p class="story"><span class="who">Who am I?</span> <br><br>My curiosity and will for improvement have made me
            someone who loves to innovate. I learned quite early, still during my first projects attempts, that the
            ability to analyze and interpret data is one of the most essential skills needed not only in a working
            environment, but in life as whole. Most of my mistakes at the beginning were caused by the impetus of taking
            an initiative without previous analysis.
            But those failures were not enough to make me give up; instead, I became an extremely analytical person who pays a lot
            of attention to details. I focused my professional career on a constant searching for improvement and
            development of new tools and processes, creating solutions using management concepts like PDCA and 5W2H and
            also working with systems such as Advanced Excel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qlik"
                target="_blank"> QlikView</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableau_Software" target="_blank">Tableau</a>, and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableau_Software" target="_blank">Power BI</a>. <br>
            Another characteristic very present in my life is how I relate to other people, especially during delicate
            moments when I am able to keep calm and coordinate actions and behaviors. Putting this all together, I
            worked more than 10 years as a Business Analyst interpreting and managing demands from business and
            technical areas. Since I can't get stuck in only one thing, I'm currently in love with the development and
            web programming, and dedicating my time to learn and expand my knowledge in tools such as HTML, CSS, JS,
            React, etc.<br> Lets see where this will take me... </p>

        <p class="education"><span class="who">My education.</span> <br><br>After I finished high school, I entered the
            <a href="https://www.unifor.br/" target="_blank">University of Fortaleza (Unifor) </a>in the
            Business Administration program. During my time in University I never stopped working, which really helped
            me to better understand the courses I was taking and put in practice what I was learning. I graduated in
            2010, and after that, I started the searching for a specific knowledge in the Business Intelligence field.
            In 2015 I did a great course to learn how to Map and Improve process with the <a
                href="https://www.falconi.com/en/" target="_blank"> Falconi Consulting</a>. Then, I took a different one
            to improve my Management skills which was a Leadership Development Certificate, with<a
                href="https://www.fdc.org.br/en/programs/executive-mba" target="_blank"> Dom Cabral Foundation</a>.<br>
            Living in Canada, I developed a huge interest on the web development area. So, once again, I went deep in
            studying to learn about it. In 2019 I took an online course on HTML, CSS, JS, and React at <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"> Codecademy</a>, and after that, in 2020, I enrolled
            in a React course at <a href="https://www.comit.org/" target=")blank"> CmIt</a> to learn more about Frontend
            development. In the same year, I started a program at <a href="udemy.com" target="_blank">
                Udemy </a>called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-fullstack-course/learn/"
                target="_blank">The complete React Fullstack course.</a> <br> And I will not stop here!!!</p>

        <p class="education"><span class="who">Being part of a team.</span> <br><br>I got my first formal job exactly on
            the day I turned 19 years old, but I will focus on telling my experience from the time I was hired by the
            largest coffee company in Brazil:<br><a href="www.cafe3coracoes.com.br" targe="_blank"> - Café
                3Coracoes.</a><br> At this company, I learned all the foundation needed for the job as a Business
            Analyst and I can say that I made part of the most competitive team I have ever heard of. I worked there for
            9 years and a half; at first, as a data analyst, responsible for collecting all the data from the commercial
            area and feeding the dashboards and reports for the commercial management and commercial board. After 3
            years, I was invited to be responsible for implanting a business intelligence sector in the Sao Paulo
            branch. I spent another 3 years in the area of Business Intelligence there, when I was transferred to the
            commercial area to work as a Sales Supervisor and then as a Sales Manager. I left the company to try my own
            business, which was an amazing experience, but I received a pretty good offer to work in a company
            called:<br><a href="http://www.cialne.com.br/" target="_blank">- CIALNE.</a><br> There I was the Manager of
            Business Intelligence for 4 years. My main duties were to lead a team of analysts responsible for improving
            the company’s processes, creating and implementing innovative tools in partnership with the IT department
            and commercial area, and managing new projects. During the time I worked for this company I really improved
            a my management skills because I was working directly with the CEO and a team of external consultants.
            I left the company to move to Canada, and arriving here my first entry level job was as a customer service
            agent in a call center company called:<br><a href="https://millennium1solutions.com/" target="_blank">-
                Millennium 1 Solutions.</a><br> There I worked with the PC MasterCard account, for one year and a half,
            starting in the sales area, then being transferred to the customer's retention area, and also training new
            agents. Finally, the last company I have worked for, until September 2020 was:<br><a
                href="https://www.cascades.com/en/facilities/cascades-recovery-ottawa" target="_blank"> - Casacades
                Recovery +.</a> <br>I was hired as a Scale Administrator responsible for controlling the entry and exit
            of all shipments, ensuring that they were within the defined parameters. I was also responsible for feeding
            daily spreadsheets and System, and sending daily reports to the administrative area. In this company I had
            the great opportunity to improve their tools and optimize their processes.</p>
